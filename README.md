# VkMusicToSoundCloud
Easy way to import your VkMusic playlist to other platforms, in current version - soundcloud.
###  Setup
To use this script you need to clone repository or download and unpack zip, then run
`pip install -r requirements.txt` and then create `config.py` file and fill it with variables similar to `config sample`.  Also you need to place  [chromedriver]([http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)) to the same directory, where the project is.
### Usage
When all the setup is done, you should run `main.py` , and then, when you get the list of all your songs from VkMusic, you should open Google Chrome (not tested in other browsers) so that you can switch to it using `alt+tab`, and run `soundscloud_bot.py`.

This script will get control over your mouse and keyboard, so you should control it's work at first.  If you see, that it's stable, you can leave your computer for about five minutes, till the script finishes it's work.

**If you see, that something weird is happening, place cursor in th top-left of the screen: it will stop the script immediatly**.
